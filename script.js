// Project 1: Function Conversion
/* 
Objective: To practice and understand the usage of arrow functions in JavaScript.
Challenge: You will be given a JavaScript file containing several regular functions. Your task is to convert these functions into arrow functions.
Requirements: Preserve the original functionality of the code while converting. Verify your conversion by testing the output of each function.
Difficulty: Beginner
*/

// Here are functions to convert:

function greeting(name) {
  return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}

// A function that squares a number
function square(num) {
  return num * num;
}

// A function that takes two numbers and returns their sum
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// A function that takes a number and returns true if the number is even, false otherwise
function isEven(num) {
  return num % 2 === 0;
}

// A function that takes a string and returns its reverse
function reverseString(str) {
  return str.split("").reverse().join("");
}

// Project 2: Conditional Rendering
/* 
Objective: To understand the use of ternary operators for conditional rendering in JavaScript.
Challenge: Create a simple web page where the content changes based on a variable's value, using a ternary operator.
Requirements: The variable can be of any type. The webpage should display different content based on at least three different states of the variable.
Difficulty: Beginner/Intermediate
